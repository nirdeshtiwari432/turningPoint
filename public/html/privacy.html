      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Effective date: <strong>September 21, 2025</strong></p>

      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>[Your Library Name]</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, discloses, and protects personal information when you visit or use our website, mobile applications, and library services. By using our services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect information to provide and improve our services. Types of information we collect include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal information:</strong> name, email address, postal address, phone number, date of birth (if provided), library card number, and other contact details you provide when registering for membership, placing holds, or using our services.</li>
        <li><strong>Account data:</strong> login credentials (securely stored), membership status, borrowing history, hold requests, fines and payments related to library services.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment information:</strong> when you make payments (e.g., fines, fees), we may collect payment card or transaction information. We do not store full payment card data on our servers â€” payments are processed through secure third-party payment processors. See "Third-Party Services" below.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> information about how you use our website and services, such as pages visited, features used, IP address, browser type, device information, and timestamps.</li>
        <li><strong>Communications:</strong> records of communications you send to us (for example, email or support requests), and our responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> we use cookies and web beacons to remember preferences, support login sessions, and collect analytics.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We may use the information we collect for purposes including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Providing, operating, and maintaining library services and accounts.</li>
        <li>Processing checkouts, holds, renewals, fines, and payments.</li>
        <li>Communicating with you about your account, due dates, library events, changes to services, and important notices.</li>
        <li>Improving our website and services, performing analytics, and preventing fraud and abuse.</li>
        <li>Personalizing your experience (e.g., reading recommendations, saved searches) when you opt in.</li>
        <li>Complying with legal obligations and responding to lawful requests from authorities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p>We will not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., payment processors, hosting, analytics, email delivery). They are contractually required to protect your data.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal obligations:</strong> if required by law, court order, or government regulation, or to respond to legal process.</li>
        <li><strong>Protection of rights:</strong> to protect the rights, property, or safety of the library, our users, or others.</li>
        <li><strong>With your consent:</strong> when you explicitly request or authorize sharing (for example, interlibrary loan partners you choose to share information with).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Cookies &amp; Tracking</h2>
      <p>We use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to operate our site and provide analytics. You may control cookie preferences through your browser settings. Blocking cookies may limit certain features of the site.</p>

      <h2>5. Security</h2>
      <p>We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards intended to protect your personal information. These measures include access controls, encrypted connections (HTTPS), and routine security reviews. However, no system is fully secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

      <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain personal data only as long as necessary to provide services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Account information and borrowing history may be kept according to applicable library policies and local record-retention laws.</p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal data, including the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing. To exercise these rights, contact us using the details below. We may require verification before fulfilling requests.</p>

      <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Our services are intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent. If you believe we have collected information from a child without consent, please contact us to request deletion.</p>

      <h2>9. Third-Party Links &amp; Services</h2>
      <p>Our site may contain links to third-party websites and services (e.g., catalogs, digital lenders, event platforms). This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy notices before using them.</p>

      <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
      <p>If we transfer personal information across national borders (for example, to cloud providers), we will take reasonable steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place in accordance with applicable law.</p>

      <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When changes are significant, we will provide a prominent notice (for example, posting an announcement on the website). The updated policy will include the "Effective date" at the top.</p>
